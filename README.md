# Master's Project Playground

Repository for Master's project related stuff.

Currently, contains basic functionality to extract change transactions from data diffs (`simplifiedData/`).

- `find_changes.py` extracts change transactions when a directory (e. g., `some/path/simplifiedData`)
- `find_dependencies.iypnb` can be used to run apriori algorithm on these transactions
